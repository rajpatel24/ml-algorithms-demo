# ML Algorithms Demo

****

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the 7 most common types of classification algorithms.

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Byes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Stochastic Gradient

****

Following steps are involved in building a classification model:

1. Initialize the classifier
2. Train the classifier
3. Predict the target
4. Evaluate the classifier model

I have used following dataset for this project:
